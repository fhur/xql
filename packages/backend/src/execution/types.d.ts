 * # Execution Plan
 *
 * The execution plan tree describes the steps that
 * need to be taken to execute a query, as well as
 * which strategies are taken to execute each query.
 *
 * A parent â†’ child relationship between nodes means that
 * the parent needs to be executed before the child.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 *        DB
 *      /    \
 *     DB     http
 *     |       |  \
 *    http     DB  http
 * ```
 *
 * In this example, the root node is executed using the DB executor.
 * Once the root node is executed, the two children nodes can be
 * executed in parallel.
